# matching-game-app

TODO:
* add to todo list
* Find database of questions, or flashcards. Quizlet? I am looking for words, not questions. 
* Create Initial Webpage


IDEAS:
* Maybe give each word multiple descriptons that can match it

    IE: Agile:

            1. Incremental and iterative project management.

            2. What style of management would a project manager likely utilize in a personal project

            3.
* You are only garunteed 1 match.
* Maybe make the cards appear on top and bottom instead of left and right, that way an easier control scheme can be used. (123, 890)
* % Chance that there is no match, and the player has to call it out? Low chance



GAME FLOW: (panorama paramour or whatever the word was)

    1. game Initialization

    2. the words are generated on the left

    3. the definitions/questions are generated on the right

    4. the keys (QAZ, OKM) (QWE, IOP) are displayed next to the boxes

    5. A timer at 2 minutes begins.

    6. From the generated words and definitions, 1 MUST be a guarunteed match, the others may or may not be matches

    7. The player must select a combination of 1 word and 1 definition.

        6a. If correct, the player gets points and the game moves on

        6b. If incorrect, the game pauses and explains the correct answer. OR does this happen at the end of the game?

    8. After a match is declared, the matching word on the left is replaced, and all 3 definitions are replaced (with 1 definition being a guarunteed match).

    9. The player continues 7-8 until the time runs out.

    10. At the end of the game, the player is given a score and accuracy, and is offered to review the ones they got wrong.

I intend to use this resource while creating my database, but rephrasing the definitions, providing multiple for variance, etc.

VOCAB:
* Velocity
